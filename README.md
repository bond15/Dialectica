2022 AMS MRC on Applied Category Theory

1. basic categories

2. DialSet.agda = chapters 1 and 2 of https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf over Set,
This exists in two different shapes: objects as subsets of U \times X or U\times X--> Two, which are equivalent in Set.
(later DialC, C any finite limit, CCC cat)

3. LDialSet.agda = chapters 3 and 4 of https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf, over Set
(later LDialC, C any finite limit, CCC cat)

4. Lineales = poset reflection of an smcc (symmetric monoidal closed category)
(to begin with Two, later Three, Four, Q, Z, R, [0,1])

5. \*-autonomous posets = Girard algebras (possibly)

6. Petri nets uses two relations pre, post: U\times X --> L or in the new notation pre, post: pos A\times dir A --> Two

7. Event structures (possibly)

8. Poly = chapter  1,2, ..
